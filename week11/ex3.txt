In the first program, we see "hello" two times because parent copies string to the buffer(do not print) then creates child this copies buffer then parent sees "/n" and prints "hello" from buffer and child makes the same
In the second program parent prints "hello" before creating child so child has empty buffer so the child does not print "hello"
